# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

So far we have covered the two visual, building-block languages for web app development (HTML & CSS).
We need one more ability to create our perfect application.
As it stands our application will display content beautifully, but it can't change or do anything.
It's like a painting.
However websites usually have some form of user interaction.

That's were languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and CoffeeScript come in.
They equip our website to be able to have behaviors, include dynamic content, interact with our users.
In this section we look at JavaScript in detail, how to program in it and use some of its advanced features for our web applications.

## Structure

There are 6 chapters, and all (bar the first chapter) will have a number of sections.
Some sections may contain subsections which are tasks / challenges to complete.

## TODO
* If you are **completely new to JavaScript** or have only recently been introduced to it, read through all the sections and complete the tasks.

* If you have **moderate / advanced experience with JavaScript** I would advise just doing the tasks and looking into sections that you might not be familiar with.

_**NOTE:** Don't skip this entire part of the training. There are some advanced techniques used here that even experienced users of JavaScript may not know!_
