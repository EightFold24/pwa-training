# Native Web APIs

## What is an API?
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are programed constructs which abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
Watch this [API introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) to get a feel for what APIs are.

## What is a Native Web API?
Modern browsers have built in web APIs that allow programmers to do useful tasks such as modify content, play audio, fetch data from servers.

## TODO
