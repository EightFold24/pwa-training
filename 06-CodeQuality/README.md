# Clean Code

> ### “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” 
> – Martin Fowler

Every year, a tremendous amount of time and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. Developers very often rush because they feel pressure from their managers or from the client to get the job done quickly, sometimes even sacrificing on quality.

When we talk about clean code, we talk about a reader-focused development style that produces software that’s easy to write, read, and maintain. 

## What is Clean Code?
Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.
Your code should be as efficient, readable, and maintainable as possible, and instead of only solving the problem, you should always put a bit of extra time in to focus on the design of your code, on architecture.

## Why Does Clean Code Matter?
1. You're an author - you need to write clearly
2. Using best practices elevates code maintainability
3. Justification for used technique is obvious
4. Reading is hard - make the life of others easier
5. Rubbish / confusing code contributes to technical debt in projects
6. Clean code is easier to test
7. Programmers are lazy and might make quick assumptions
8. Clean code saves time, and therefore money $$$
