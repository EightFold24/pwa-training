# Ditch the server with AWS

Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning.

There are a number of different providers of serverless capabilities such as...
* Azure Functions
* Google Cloud
* IBM Cloud Functions

But in this tutorial we are going to use Amazon's AWS to give our website a backend datastore.

## TODO

This tutorial is broken up into five modules. You must complete each module before proceeding to the next. However, modules 1 and 2 have AWS CloudFormation templates available that you can use to launch the necessary resources without manually creating them yourself. The templates let you skip those modules.  

1. [Static Web Hosting]()
2. [User Management]()
3. [Serverless Backend]()
4. [RESTful APIs]()
5. [Resource Termination and Next Steps]()
