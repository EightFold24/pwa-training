# Ditch the server with AWS

###Prerequisites
For this part of the tutorial it assumes you have a basic website with a form integrated into it, and at least one Javascript file.

###Content
You've run your website and used data from your local machine, but in the real world this is not a practical solution.

This part of the tutorial will show you how to connect to and insert into a serverless database hosted by AWS.

Throughout this tutorial we will explore some of the commonly used serverless functions in AWS. You are likely to use these commonly throughout your time in Applied Innovation. The functions we will explore are:
* API Gateways
* Lambdas
* DynamoDB
