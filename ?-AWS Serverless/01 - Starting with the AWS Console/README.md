###Introduction to DynamoDB
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.

Or put simply...

DynamoDB is a simple database which contains tables that store and retrieve data. These tables are easily scaled if there is demand. There are three main DynamoDB components; tables, items and attributes. A brief description of each has been included below.
 * Tables - A table is a collection of data, tables have a name and contain Items.
 * Items - A table can contain 0 or more items. An item is a group of attributes that are uniquely identifiable.
 * Attributes - A Item is made of one or more attributes. A attribute is a fundamental data element that cannot be broken down any further.
