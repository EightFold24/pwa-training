# Welcome to this README

As you might have noticed by now, this entire training course is written in README format.
The reasoning behind this is that it can be maintained on a source control platform like GitHub while also being easily previewed online.

**_NOTE: In this section we refer to a README as a single document as a summary, guide, and troubleshooter for the project it is placed in.
Difference to the use of README files that are used in this training course._**

In this section we are going to talk about the importance of written good README documents for projects, and the benefits from taking the time to get them right!

_**NOTE: Do not skip this section! It is more important than you think.**_

## Why should I care about READMEs?

One of the most important reasons for having the ability to write great READMEs is for reproducibility.
Consider if I read a research article that concludes that through experimentation, eating apples slows down the aging process, but when I try the same experiment documented, I do not get the same results. 
This may be because the research article wasn't done correctly.
However another possibility is that it wasn't documented well enough how the experiment was executed.

The same could be said about software.
How many times have you installed a new package/library/other software and needed to lookup the documentation on how to use it.
If your system doesn't have the clear instructions necissary to run it / understand it enough to develop, then you run the risk of writing code already **on its way to the grave!**
If another team member cannot understand a piece of software and has no documentation to help them, they will likely replace those parts or move to another system entirely.

READMEs raises the profile of your project, especially if it is open source.
Developers release new open-source projects on GitHub every day so it is becoming more and more difficult to get your own project to stand out.

Projects on GitHub aren't always viewed by technical people.
With a well written README a non-technical recruiter for example can see what technologies/programming languages you have used and can see what domain you apply most of your effort in, whether that be security, frontend, or server-side.

## README.md - What's it all about?
The `.md` extension comes from a word: _markdown_. It's a markup language for text formatting. 
Maybe at first it isn't be obvious but markup has been created to make text creation easier. 
In HTML language, the most important heading goes with `h1` tag. 
Similarity, we will have `#` before a heading in our document.

We edit `.md` files in any text or code editor (Notepad, Sublime, Atom, CS, etc.). 

You'll find out more on markdown usage on [GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), and on [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) you'll find an editor with a preview.

## What is in a good README?
Make sure the file always includes the following elements:

* Titles and internal titles
* Introduction - the project's aim
* Technologies
* Launch

Consider also using additional elements such as: 

* Table of contents
* Illustrations
* Scope of functionalities 
* Examples of use
* Project status 
* Sources
* Other information

## Monkey See Monkey Do
Have a look at the example README and take inspiration from it to write your own.
Keep in mind that you must always aim to write a README with as much detail and explanation as a beginner would need to understand.
**Don't assume your views have prior knowledge!**

## TODO
* Add a `README.md` file to your project
