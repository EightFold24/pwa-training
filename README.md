# Progressive Web Applications

NOTE: This is a WIP copy of the training and will be added to / changed.

## TODO
* Sections 01 - 06 are in a usable state
* Section 01 is a refresher course - skip if you already know the basics
* Section 02 is an in-depth refresher course - if you already know javascript, attempt the tasks and read into sections that you did not get/know the solutions for
* Record how long you spend on each of the 7 sections
* Section 07 will be based off [this AWS tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/) but is not finished*
* If you have time, look through data-storage

*_If you are an experienced AWS user, you can attempt section 07 using the above guide, and the below steps..._

- Add your website to an S3 bucket with objects set to public read only access
- Create a DynamoDB and lambda function for storing the input to your website form
- Create the API Gateway to access your website
