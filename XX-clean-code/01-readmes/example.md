## Project title
A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about.
Might also include a short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. 
This should explain **why** the project exists.

Below the project description you can include build status of continuous integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc, and if you're using any code style like xo, standard etc.
That will help others while contributing to your project.

## Code Example / Use Cases
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
Use code blocks in markdown like so...
````text
```codetype
A code block is sourrounded by three backticks (`)
The codetype is optional but when included tells markdown what language to format the text with.
This could be a number of things including 'js', 'html', or 'markdown'
```
````
